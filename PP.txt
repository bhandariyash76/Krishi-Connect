3.2 Use Case Diagrams
The system has three main actors: Farmer, Buyer, and Admin. Key use cases are:
• Farmer registers, creates/view contracts, receives payments, and raises disputes.
• Buyer registers, negotiates contracts, makes payments, and confirms deliveries.
• Admin monitors transactions, manages disputes, and maintains system integrity.
Note: The actual Use Case Diagram should be created using tools like StarUML, Lucidchart, or draw.io
and inserted as a figure here. Example placeholder:

3.3 Interfaces
The system requires multiple interfaces to ensure smooth communication between software components,
hardware, and users.
3.3.1 Software Interfaces
• Frontend: Web and mobile-first interface developed using React.js/Flutter for farmers and buy-
ers.
• Backend: REST API developed using Node.js/Flask/Django to handle core business logic.
• Database: Relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for storing contracts, user profiles, and
transaction records.
• Payment Gateway: Integration with services like Razorpay/Paytm for secure digital payments.
• Authentication: Secure login using JWT/OAuth2.
3.3.2 Hardware Interfaces
• Client Devices: Smartphones (Android/iOS) or computers with internet connectivity.
• Server: Cloud-hosted virtual machine or server with minimum configuration: Quad-core CPU,
8GB RAM, and scalable storage.
3.3.3 Communication Interfaces
• Internet Protocols: HTTPS for secure communication between client and server.
• Notification Services: SMS gateway and email service for contract updates and reminders.
• Third-Party APIs: Optional integration with weather APIs or advisory systems for additional
farmer support.
3.4 Methodology
The methodology adopted for this project ensures systematic development and testing of the proposed
system:
10
1. Requirement Gathering: Identify challenges faced by farmers and buyers and translate them
into functional and non-functional requirements.
2. System Design: Define architecture, use cases, and data models.
3. Module Development: Build independent modules (Farmer, Buyer, Admin, Payment).
4. Integration: Connect modules and third-party services (payment, notifications).
5. Testing and Validation: Conduct functional, usability, and security testing.
6. Deployment: Launch the pilot system and collect user feedback.
This iterative methodology ensures that user needs remain central throughout the project lifecycle.

Work Distribution
4.1 Task Allocation
The project has been undertaken by a team of three students: Anmol Purohit, Lalit Gaur, and
Yash Bhandari. To ensure systematic progress, tasks were distributed among the team members
according to their skills and areas of interest.
• Anmol Purohit: Focused on frontend interface development, use case documentation, project
documentation and testing.
• Lalit Gaur: Handled requirement analysis, report writing, and coordination of modules
• Yash Bhandari: Responsible for database design, backend development, and system integration.
This distribution ensures parallel development of system components and timely integration.
4.2 Module Details
The proposed system is divided into distinct modules for clarity and better management:
1. Farmer Module: Registration, contract creation, viewing available contracts, payment tracking.
2. Buyer Module: Registration, searching for farmers, negotiating contracts, making payments.
3. Admin Module: Monitoring transactions, resolving disputes, and system maintenance.
4. Payment Module: Secure payment gateway integration (Razorpay/Paytm).
12
5. Notification Module: SMS/email alerts for contract milestones, delivery reminders, and pay-
ment confirmations.
4.3 Remark
The team adopted a collaborative approach where members contributed to each other’s domains when
required. Regular team meetings were held to review progress, resolve issues, and ensure alignment with
project goals. This cooperative work distribution facilitated timely completion of the initial project
phases and will continue throughout the development lifecycle.

Design Document
This chapter presents the detailed design of the proposed system. It includes the functional description,
functional partitions, data organization, user interface design, module specifications, and process flow
representations. The design ensures that the system is modular, scalable, and user-friendly.
5.1 Functional Description
The Assured Contract Farming System is designed to connect farmers and buyers through a digital
platform that ensures transparent and legally valid contracts. The system supports the following core
functions:
• Farmer Functions: Registration, contract creation, negotiation, payment tracking, and dispute
raising.
• Buyer Functions: Registration, contract negotiation, payment processing, and delivery confir-
mation.
• Admin Functions: Monitoring transactions, dispute resolution, and maintaining system secu-
rity.
• Payment Functions: Secure digital transactions via integrated payment gateways.
• Notification Functions: Automated SMS/email alerts for contract milestones and payment
confirmations.
14
5.2 Functional Partitions
The system is divided into logical modules, each performing a specific set of tasks:
1. Farmer Module: Registration, contract management, and payment receipt.
2. Buyer Module: Product search, contract negotiation, and secure payments.
3. Admin Module: System monitoring, user management, and dispute resolution.
4. Payment Module: Handles secure integration with third-party payment gateways.
5. Notification Module: Sends reminders and alerts regarding contracts and payments.

5.3 Data Description
The database schema is designed to support contract management, user authentication, and transaction
tracking.
Table 5.1: Sample Database Schema
Field Name Data Type Constraints Description
UserID INT Primary Key Unique user identifier
UserName VARCHAR(50) Not Null Name of the user
Password VARCHAR(100) Not Null Encrypted user password
Role VARCHAR(20) Default ’User’ Defines user type (Admin/Farmer/Buyer)
ContractID INT Primary Key Unique contract identifier
PaymentID INT Foreign Key Links to payment transactions

5.4 User Interface Design
The system is designed as a mobile-first platform with simple navigation and multilingual support. The
interface provides:
• Easy registration and login.
• Dashboard for farmers and buyers to track contracts and payments.
• Notifications section for alerts and reminders.
• Support section for dispute resolution.
